# trackTrumpv2

Revamped trackTrump program

How does it work?
trackTrump.py is responsible for collecting the titles of the frontpage of r/politics and analyzing what percentage of them are about Trump. It runs and collects data every hour.

tTrumpStats.py is then responsible for collecting this hourly data and analyzing it over the course of the day as well as the entire project. This data is then output to RESULTS.txt. 

redditBot.py is responsible for posting this data on r/trumpPercent at the end of every day.




Check out r/trumpPercent or RESULTS.txt for updated data!
